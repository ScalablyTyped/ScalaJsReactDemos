## React-native 
[Expo demo you can run on your phone](https://expo.io/@scalablytyped/scalably-typed-react-native) (slinky version is deployed there)

To run this you'll need to follow the 
[Setting up the development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) 
for react-native. 

When you have an emulator running, you can start the demo like this:

```
sbt>react-native/run
```
